# FlatboxP: Flatbox rev5 fork 

This fork is now using WS2812B-V5 from JLC, which include capacitors inside the circuit and also operate on 3.3v logic from the rp2040.

For the case I remixed Pettman's flatbox5 case to have a little window to show the active area of the screen.
I'll only upload the remixed top case here, go to their repo for details and the bottom plate:

I also recommend this model for the tact switch buttons:

This repository contains a 3D-printable model, PCB design files to make an arcade controller that looks like this:
