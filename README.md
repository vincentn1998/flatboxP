WARNING: RGB LED circuit needs to be redone!!
these have a backwards sk6812-mini footprint, I'll fix this when I have time (probably change them to ws2812-bs)
OLED screen works with a ssd1306 fine.

For the case I remixed Pettman's flatbox5 case to have a little window to show the active area of the screen.
I'll only upload the remixed top case here, go to their repo for details and the bottom plate:
