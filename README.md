# FlatboxP: Low profile hitbox-layout fightstick

This fork is for a functional flatbox rev5 build with RGB and OLED. 
As of now the gerber uploaded has a board with working oled, but rgb lightning needs a revision.
Will update when I have functional build with the features mentioned above.

This repository contains 3D-printable models, PCB design files and code needed to make an arcade controller that looks like this:

There are five major versions of the Flatbox. They all use Kailh low profile (choc v1) mechanical keyboard switches. The table below lists their main features. See the README for each version for details on how to make them.
